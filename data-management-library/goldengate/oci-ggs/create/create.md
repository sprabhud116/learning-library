# Create the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Deployment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment.

Estimated time: 5 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Deployments
A Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console to create and manage processes such as Extracts and Replicats.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create a OCI GoldenGate deployment
* Review the OCI GoldenGate deployment details
* Access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you completed all preceding labs.

## Task 1: Create a deployment

You're brought to the Deployment Details page. It takes a few minutes for the deployment to be created. Its status will change from CREATING to ACTIVE when it is ready for you to use.

## Task 2: Review the Deployment details

On the Deployment Details page, you can:

* Review the deployment's status
* Launch the GoldenGate service deployment console
* Edit the deployment's name or description
* Stop and start the deployment
* Move the deployment to a different compartment
* Review the deployment resource information
* Add tags

## Task 3: Launch the GoldenGate Deployment Console

1. When the deployment is active, click **Launch Console**.

After you log in, you're brought to the GoldenGate deployment console home page. Here, you can access the GoldenGate Administration, Performance Metrics, Distribution, and Receiver Services, as well as add Extracts and Replicats for your data replication tasks.

In this lab, you created an OCI Deployment, reviewed its Deployment details, and launched the Deployment Console. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
